# The Reboot Debugger
A reboot fixer for all kind of issues with Project Reboot. Potentially can work on other projects like Nova, or Rift
It will not open anything, it should automatically look and fix issues your having. Such as no dll or error messages.
TURN OFF YOUR ANTI VIRUS! It detects it as a false positive because it looks through your system and adds files (for reboot)

Download it from the releases tab!

## FOR SOME REASON IT SOMETIMES CRASHES DISCORD AND RESTARTS IT! DO NOT PANIC IF THIS HAPPENS! (i haven't been able to fix it)
